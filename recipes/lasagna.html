    <p><strong>HOW TO DO THIS YUMMY YUMMY LASAGNA</strong></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef and Italian sausage, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Cook until browned and no longer pink. Remove any excess grease.</li>
        <li>Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Sauté until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Simmer the sauce for about 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and half of the grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Now it's time to layer the lasagna! Start by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread a generous layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a sprinkling of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, alternating between the meat sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture, and mozzarella cheese until you run out of ingredients. Make sure to finish with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining grated Parmesan cheese evenly over the lasagna. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it's tightly sealed.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Once the lasagna is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves for a pop of color and added freshness.</li>
